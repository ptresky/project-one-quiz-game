# Quiz Time is the Name of the Game

### Description: 
This quiz game is based similarly to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" where a wrong answer will end the game rather than tallying points. 

### Why?: 
I have always been a fan of miscellaneous and obscure trivia. Jeopardy is always on my DVR. 

### Getting Started:

### Next Steps:
Future Enhancements to the game would include more quiz categories, an initial main page menu with options, hint options, and improved animations.
