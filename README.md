# Quiz Time is the Name of the Game

### Description: 
This quiz game is based similarly to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" where a wrong answer will end the game rather than tallying points. 

### Why?: 
I have always been a fan of miscellaneous and obscure trivia. Jeopardy is always on my DVR. 

### Getting Started: 
Live Website: [Quiz Time](https://ptresky.github.io/project-one-quiz-game/)

> Answer each trivia question presented. If your answer is correct, you move on to the next question. If your answer is incorrect, you lose! But you can always try again. Answer all questions correctly and you win!
